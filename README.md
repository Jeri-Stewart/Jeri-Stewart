- 👋 **Hi, I’m @Jeri-Stewart** <br /> 
My career and experiences were initiated by my childhood interest in puzzles and reading books. Over time, I became intrigued by the wonders of science and enthusiastically enrolled at the University of Georgia to cultivate these interests. The courses that I took were strenuous and challenged me greatly; the courses pushed and disciplined me to demonstrate and acuminate my skills such as critical thinking, data analysis, and technical laboratory skills.
I joined a lab within the College of Engineering department that focuses on biomedical translational and interdisciplinary research. The lab developed biocompatible coatings for medical devices as well as performed fundamental cell/protein surface interaction studies and material testing in animal models. 
My enthusiasm and resolve to cultivate my interest in public health landed me a position at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a biologist and ORISE Fellow with the Rickettsial Diagnostic Team. The Rickettsial Diagnostic Lab provides quality clinical diagnostics focusing on Rickettsial and Q Fever pathogens.
